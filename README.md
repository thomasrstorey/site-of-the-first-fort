# site of the first fort (or, map of La Florida Archipelago)

## General idea

Map, powered by mapbox.js, serves as interface to fictional, fragmentary texts. Combine actual monument texts with fictional stories. Use a markov chain model to combine? Or use dariusk's Corpora with monument texts and RiTa to construct controlled, variable narrative bits for each island.
